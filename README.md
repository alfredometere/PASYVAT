Dear users/developers,

The software aims to offer a powerful, parallel visualization
and analysis tool for processing data that can be represented
as particles,  without the  need of reinventing the wheel for
each time particles systems analysis is required.

This tool was born as an  examination project for a course in
Programming in  Science  and  Technology,  organized  by  the
National Graduate School for Scientific Computing of Sweden.

Numerous are  the tools that can be adapted for such purpose,
including popular names in scientific computing.

However, it  is  not  negligible the amount of work needed to
adapt  the general  purpose tools available  for such  scope,
hence the advantage  of this  tool.  You just  load your data
from CSV files, analyze it, save the results and publish!

Since it costed efforts and time to develop it, if you find it
useful, please do not forget to put a reference to me.

I thank you in advance for your contributions!

Enjoy using or editing this software!

Cheers,
Alfredo Metere
