PASYVAT
=======

Installation Instructions
-------------------------

At the root directory you will find:
1) Makefile
2) Python script (executable as a regular shell command)

How to use Makefile
-------------------

The Makefile is intended to:
1) Compile the FORTRAN modules needed to run the software
2) Do general housekeeping.

To compile all modules (now is just one) just type "make"

To clean up everything, type "make clean"

After  you  compile  the module(s),  you are ready to go,
just typing "./pasyvat" at the command prompt.

Enjoy! :-)
